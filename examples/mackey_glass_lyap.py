"""
For instance, we can calculate and print the Lyapunov exponents for the Mackey–Glass system as follows (central changes to the example from `example` highlighted):

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/mackey_glass_lyap.py
	:dedent: 1
	:lines: 17-49
	:emphasize-lines: 11-12, 19-20, 22, 28, 30-33
	:linenos:

Note that `integrate` does not only return local Lyapunov exponents but also the length of the time interval to which they apply (which differs from the time spanned by the `integrate` command and may even be zero). This length should be used to weigh the local Lyapunov exponents for statistical processing, like in line 31.
